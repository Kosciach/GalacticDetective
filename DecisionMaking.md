<h2 align="center">Types of desicions</h2>
<p align="center">
  Player has 3 options to choose from: shoot down, jam the signal, let the ship go.<br>
  But only one of those is the correct one for the given spaceship.
  Each of the options is represented by a button: red, blue, green.
  Pressing the right button will give player a point, 2 other ones will take players life and if all 3 lifes are taken, gameover.

<br>
<h2 align="center">How to make right decision</h2>
<p align="center">
  In order to make a correct decision, player has to decode the signal and get the true data about a ship.
  But player doesn't know if the data is correct, for player will always receive a data, but the correct one will only show up after succesfull decoding.
  Data must later be compared to this in a special book next to the computer, to see what type of spaceship is currently checked.

  There are 3 types of spaceship, just like there are 3 buttons and 3 decissions.<br>
  1| Satelite - human spaceship, must be left alone. Use book to recognize.<br>
  2| Aliens - hostiles, red button is the correct one. Use book to recognize.<br>
  3| Spies - ships trying to steal data, jam their signal to prevent that. After succefull decoding check if computer camera is red, normally it shouldn't be.<br>
