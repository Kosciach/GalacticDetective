<h2 align="center">Generating</h2>
<p align="center">
  Each time player receives a signal, game generates 6character code from *,#,@ (729 combinations).
  Generating this code works on random numbers, on each for loop iteration random number is choosen(0-2), and used as index.
  Index represents 3 characters from the array, when new character is selected with index it is added to string which creates code when the loop ends.

<h2 align="center">Decoding</h2>
<p align="center">
  Game doesn't tell player if he decoded the signal correctly, and always shows the data but the correct one is only shown if player did the decoding right.
  Each of the characters represents a sounds, similar to index representing a character.
  When player presses the play button sound for each character is played, and since there are 6 characters a small rhytm is created.
  To correctly decode the signal player has to enter the correct character on the computer using only 6 sounds and a note on the right.
